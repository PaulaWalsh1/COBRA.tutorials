%% INTRODUCTION
% The COBRA Toolbox offers the possibility to add additional constraints to 
% a model that are not direct flux constraints. One example is already indicated 
% in the constraining models tutorial which introduces coupling constraints[1], 
% but there are plenty of other possibilities that can be achieved using constraints.
% 
% The tools introduced in this tutorial are mainly aimed at developers who 
% want to implement complex algorithms or formalism within the COBRA Toolbox environment, 
% but the basics are also useful to integrate specific properties of a model or 
% specific literature data. The section "The COBRA Model structure" is aimed at 
% developers and can be skipped by users who don't to go into the details.
% 
% 
%% The COBRA Model structure
% In general, the COBRA toolbox represents a model in a struct using multiple 
% fields to represent the different properties of the model. Of particular interest 
% for analysis is the stoichiometric matrix S (which represents the metabolic 
% stoichiometries of the reactions in the model). Under normal circumstances, 
% this matrix can directly be translated into the linear problem matrix A of a 
% problem struct as used by the Toolbox. However, since there are several algorithms 
% which aim at manipulating reactions or metabolites, it is important to draw 
% a distinction between the stoichiometric matrix S and any other constraints 
% or variables which can be added to the model.
% 
% Therefore 3 additional matrices exist, where such information can be stored:
% 
% E - The matrix indicating the influence of additional variables on metabolite 
% levels.
% 
% C - The matrix of additional constraints on the reactions, which are not 
% derived from the steady state condition and
% 
% D - The matrix of interactions between additional Constraints and additional 
% variables.
% 
% Overall A COBRA model will be translated into a Linear problem by combining 
% these matrices in the following way:
% 
% $$LPproblem\ldotp A=\text{ }\left\lbrack \begin{array}{c}model\ldotp S 
% & model\ldotp E\\model\ldotp C & model\ldotp D\end{array}\right\rbrack$$ 
% 
% The Cobra toolbox allows one sided inequality constraints and equality 
% constraints on a model. i.e. there is currently no mechanism to add a constraint 
% like:
% 
% $$c_{low} \le v_{R1} \le c_{high}$$
% 
% directly. Instead it would be necessary to add the two constraints:
% 
% $$c_{low} \le v_{R1}$$
% 
% and
% 
% $$ v_{R1} \le c_{high}$$
% 
% which is commonly what solvers will translate these constraints into anyways. 
% 
% It is best practice to not manually alter the sizes of these matrices, 
% but to use the appropriate model manipulation functions (addReaction/addMultipleReactions, 
% addMetabolite/addMultipleMetabolites, addCOBRAVariables, addCOBRAConstraints). 
% These functions will ensure, that the model structure stays in sync, and all 
% necessary fields are updated appropriately. There is a convenience function 
% to create the corresponding LPproblem struct to the given model: buildLPproblemFromModel(). 
% This function will create and initialize all necessary fields and builds the 
% corresponding LP problem. Any additional modifications of the LP problem imposed 
% by an algorithm should be done on this LP and not on the original model structure.
% 
% 
% 
% 
%% PROCEDURE
% Initially, we will load a model that we want to modify by adding a few additional 
% constraints. The model used will be the simple E.Coli core model:
%%
initCobraToolbox(false)
model = getDistributedModel('ecoli_core_model.mat');
%Create a copy for comparisons
model_orig = model;
%% 
% We will add a restriction on the activity of the two aconitase proteins 
% present in E.Coli (aconA and aconB), which catalyse two steps in the citric 
% acid cycle (see below)
% 
% 
% 
% From UNIPROT[2], the Km value of aconitase acting on citrate is 6.13 and 
% 23.8 umol/min/mg for aconA and aconB respectively. For cis-aconitate the values 
% are 14.5 and 39.1 umol/min/mg, respectively. Since most models assume fluxes 
% having the unit mmol/gDW/hr we will have to convert the units to mmol/hr instead 
% of umol/min:

aconACit = 6.13 / 1000 * 60;
aconAAcon = 14.5 / 1000 * 60;
aconBCit = 23.8 / 1000 * 60;
aconBAcon = 39.1 / 1000 * 60;
%% 
% From Wi≈õniewski and Rakus[3] the amount of aconA and aconB per mg E.Coli 
% sample is ~4.05 pmol/mg and 95.95 pmol/mg respectively, with a weight of 97.676 
% kDa and 93.497 kDa, respectively.

aconAmol_per_g = 4.05 * 1000 * 1e-12;
aconBmol_per_g = 95.95 * 1000 * 1e-12;
aconA_molWeight = 97.676 * 1e3;
aconB_molWeight = 93.497 * 1e3;
aconAAmount = aconAmol_per_g * aconA_molWeight / 0.3; % divided by 0.3 to account for 
                                                      % the non water fraction assuming
                                                      % 70% water.
aconBAmount = aconBmol_per_g * aconB_molWeight / 0.3;
%% 
% Now, there are two genes which code for aconitase in the ecoli core model: 
% b0118 (aconB) and b1276 (aconA). Both the citrate hydratase and the aconitatde 
% dehydratase have the same GPR rule: (b0118 or b1276), so they can both use either 
% enzyme. 

aconAgene = 'b1276';
aconBgene = 'b0118';
%% 
% We would like to add a constraint that not only restricts the activity 
% of these two reactions, but also ensures that the turnover rates are considered. 
% One mg of aconA can support a total flux of ~0.367 mmol/h of ACONTa

printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList',{'ACONTa'},'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% OR .087 mmol/hr through ACONTb.

printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList',{'ACONTb'},'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% However, it will not be able to do both at the same time. Therefore, we 
% can assume that in addition to its normal metabolites, the reaction also consumes 
% some of the enzyme (for this time step). However, both reactions can also be 
% catalysed by aconB, so they might actually not use any of aconA. Therefore, 
% we need additional constraints that represent the activity through these two 
% reactions. In addition, we need variables that represent the efficiency of one 
% mg of protein to catalyse the reactions.
% 
% Essentially, we have to encode:
% 
% A: The availability of the given proteins 
% 
% B: The efficiency of a protein to catalyse a specific reaction
% 
% C: The usage of that protein by the respective reaction.
% 
% And we will do so in this tutorial
%% Adding availability variables.
% The rxns field is intended to only represent reactions from the model, so 
% if an additional variable is required for a specific task, this variable should 
% not be generated in the rxns field, but in a distinct field for this kind of 
% variables. Therefore, we will add availability variables, which can be thought 
% of as exchange reaction for the enzymes. To do so, we use the following function
%%
%addCOBRAVariables(model, idList, varargin)
%% 
% The function takes an existing model, and a set of variable ids (*idList*) 
% and generates all required fields for these variables. You can modify the properties 
% of the variables by the following parameters which can either be supplied as 
% parameter/value pairs:

addCOBRAVariables(model,{'newVar'},'lb', -5,'ub',3);
%% 
%  or as a parameter struct:

params = struct();
params.lb = -5;
params.ub = 3;
addCOBRAVariables(model,{'newVar'},params);
%% 
% The available parameters are:
% 
% * *'lb'* - The lower bound(s) of the variable(s) (default: -1000)
% * *'ub'* - The upper bound(s) of the variable(s) (default: 1000)
% * *'c'* - The objective coefficient(s) of the variable(s) (default: 0)
% * *'Names'* - Descriptive name(s) of the variable(s) (default: idList)
% 
% We will now add the variables 'aconA' and 'aconB' with lower bounds 0 and 
% upper bounds according to the values determined above.

aconVars = {'aconA','aconB'};
model = addCOBRAVariables(model,aconVars,'lb',[0;0],'ub',[aconAAmount;aconBAmount]);
%% 
% 
%% 
% We further need a conversion between the used amount of aconA and the potential 
% flux through ACONTa. We also need this for ACONTb and the same for aconB.
%%
linkedReactions = {'ACONTa','ACONTb'};
for enzyme = 1:numel(aconVars)
    for linkedReaction = 1:numel(linkedReactions)
        model = addCOBRAVariables(model,{strcat(aconVars{enzyme},'to',linkedReactions{linkedReaction})},'lb',0);
    end
end

%% Adding usage efficiencies
% Now, we can add the respective constraints.
% 
% To do so, we will use the function 

%addCOBRAConstraints(model, idList, d, varargin)
%% 
% This function will add constraints to the given *model* using a list of 
% reactions (*idList*) involved in the constraint and right hand side values for 
% each constraint (*d*). By default, the constraint is assumed to be a limiting 
% constraint, and the coefficients of the reactions is assumed to be one. 
% 
% i.e. if you run

constMod = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'FBP','FBA'}, 5);
%% 
% The added constraint will restrict the sum of flow through 'FBP' and 'FBA' 
% to 5. The function has parameters which can be used either by parameter/value 
% pairs:

constMod = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'FBP','FBA'}, 5, 'c',[0.2,0.4],'dsense',['L']);
%% 
% or using a parameter struct:

params = struct();
params.c = [0.2,0.4];
params.dsense = 'L';
constMod = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'FBP','FBA'}, 5, params);
%% 
% The available parameters are:
% 
% * *'c'* - The coefficient matrix with one column per reaction id and one row 
% per added constraint (default: 1 for each element in *idList*)
% * *'dsense'* - the sense vector with one element per added constraint ('E' 
% for equality, 'L' for lower than, 'G' for greater than), or one element which 
% is used for all constraints (default: 'L').
% * *'ConstraintID'* - a cell array of strings with one element for each added 
% constraint (default: ConstraintXYZ, with XYZ being the position in the ctrs 
% vector)
% * *checkDuplicates* - Whether to check for duplicate Constraints (they don't 
% hurt, but they don't help). Note that duplicate IDs are still not allowed.
% 
% Coming back to our example, the first constraint we add is for the amount 
% of aconA, which should be steady (i.e. not more than made available by the aconA 
% variable). More precisely, the amount enzyme made available for ACONTa and ACONTb, 
% should be balanced with the amount of enzyme made available by the aconA variable.

model = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'aconAtoACONTa','aconAtoACONTb','aconA'},0, 'c',[-1,-1,1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'aconAAmount');
%% 
% The same constraint is introduced for aconB

model = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'aconBtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTb','aconB'},0, 'c',[-1,-1,1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'aconBAmount');
%% 
% Next, we also add the efficiencies:

model = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'aconAtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTa','ACONTa'},0, 'c',[aconACit,aconBCit,-1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'ACONTaFlux');
model = addCOBRAConstraints(model,{'aconAtoACONTb','aconBtoACONTb','ACONTb'},0, 'c',[aconAAcon,aconBAcon,-1],...
    'dsense','E', 'ConstraintID', 'ACONTbFlux');
%% 
% Finally, we have a a system, in which the two aconitase reactions are 
% competing for the available enzymes. 
%% Analysing the effects of the constraints
% If we compare the results of a simple FBA optimization of the original model, 
% and the constrained model:
%%
orig_sol = optimizeCbModel(model_orig)
restricted_sol = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% we can easily see that the obtained objective of the modified model is 
% lower than that of the original model.
% 
% Values for additional variables are stored in the solution outputs *vars_v 
% *(value used in the solution) and *vars_w *(reduced cost of the variable). For 
% constraints the respective fields are: *ctrs_y *( fordual values for constraints) 
% and *ctrs_s* (slacks for the constraints)
%% Modifying variables and constraints
% Variables and constraints can be altered by the functions changeCOBRAVariable 
% and changeCOBRAConstraint, respectively. Modifications on a variable include 
% the adjustment of upper and lower bounds (by the parameters lb/ub) as well as 
% the objective value (c) and the descriptive name (parameter 'Name').
% 
% Modifying constraints allows the adjustment of the coefficients of the 
% constraint (parameter 'c'), the directionality (parameter 'dsense') and right 
% hand side of the constraint ( parameter 'd') as well as the name (same as for 
% variables). There are several ways to update the coefficients: Either a full 
% row (including both values for the C and the E matrix - if any) needs to be 
% provided, or the IDs along with the coefficients (similar to the situation when 
% generating the constraints) need to be provided. It is important to note that 
% ALL coefficients will be reset if a constraint is modified using the changeCOBRAConstraint 
% function.
% 
% An example of these functions is provided below:
% 
% If we increase the abundance of aconA (by increasing its upper bound)
%%
model = changeCOBRAVariable(model,'aconA','ub',aconAAmount*2);
less_restricted_sol = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% We can see, that the objective increases as more flux through the TCA 
% is possible.
% 
% Similarily, if we reduce the efficiency of aconB on Citrate by 50%:

model = changeCOBRAConstraints(model,'ACONTaFlux','idList',{'aconAtoACONTa','aconBtoACONTa','ACONTa'},...
    'c',[aconACit,aconBCit*0.5,-1]);
less_efficient_aconA = optimizeCbModel(model)
%% 
% We can again see the objective drop.
% 
% While we only used a very simple example for this tutorial, this interplay 
% can improve predictive qualities substantially (for more have a look at e.g. 
% [4])
