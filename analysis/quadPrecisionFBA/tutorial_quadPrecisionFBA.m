%% INTRODUCTION
% In this tutorial, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is introduced using the E. coli 
% core model, with functions in the COBRA Toolbox v3.0 [2].  
% 
% Flux balance analysis is a solution to the optimisation problem
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\textrm{max} & c^{T}v\\\text{s.t.} & Sv=b\\ & l\leq v\leq 
% u\end{array}\end{equation}$$
% 
% where $c$ is a vector of linear objective coefficients, $S$ is an m times 
% n matrix of stoichiometric coefficients for m molecular species involved in 
% n reactions. $l\;\textrm{and}\;u\;$are n times 1 vectors that are the lower 
% and upper bounds on the n times 1 variable vector $v\;$of reaction rates (fluxes). 
% The optimal objective value is $c^{T}v^{\star}$  is always unique, but the optimal 
% vector $v^{\star}$ is usually not unique.
% 
% In summary, the data is {c,S,l,u} and the variable being optimised is v.
%% TIMING
% _< 1 hrs_
%% MATERIALS - EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Please ensure that all the required dependencies (e.g. , |git| and |curl|) 
% of The COBRA Toolbox have been properly installed by following the installation 
% guide <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html here>. 
% Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been initialised (tutorial_initialize.mlx) 
% and verify that the pre-packaged LP and QP solvers are functional (tutorial_verify.mlx).
%% PROCEDURE
%% Load a multiscale model
% To load a model from a MAT-file, you can simply use the filename (with or 
% without file extension). 

if ~exist('model','var')
    load ME_matrix_GlcAer_WT.mat
    model = modelGlcOAer_WT;
    clear modelGlcOAer_WT;
end
%% _Check the scaling properties of a stoichiometric matrix_
% The scaling properties of the stoichiometric matrix using:

[precisionEstimate, solverRecommendation] = checkScaling(model);
%% 
% If |precisionEstimate=='quad'| then the "model has badly scaled rows and colums" 
% then a quad precision solver is required. 

precisionEstimate
%% 
% Quad precision solvers come installed by default in COBRA Toolbox v3 so solverRecommendation 
% should include  {'dqqMinos'} and   {'quadMinos'}

solverRecommendation
%% 
% Change to a solution approach that combines double and quad precision to try 
% to solve the LP problem.  If they are properly installed then |solverOK == 1|

[solverOK, solverInstalled] = changeCobraSolver('dqqMinos','LP')
%[solverOK, solverInstalled] = changeCobraSolver('quadMinos','LP')
%% 
% Further information on numerical characterisation of COBRA models can be found 
% in |tutorial_numCharact.mlx|
%% Solve a quad FBA problem
% Solve a FBA problem in quad precision using |optimizeCbModel|

if solverOK
    FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'max');
end
%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% Always check the value of |solution.stat|, which returns the status of the 
% solution, even when using quad precision.
% 
% |solution.stat == 1|  means the FBA problem is solved successfully. Anything 
% else and there is a problem.
% 
% Although it does not happen often, there are many reasons why an FBA problem 
% might not solve, so they are divided into three categories. 

%      solution.stat - Solver status in standardized form:
%                      * `-1` - No solution reported (timelimit, numerical problem etc)
%                      * `1` - Optimal solution
%                      * `2` - Unbounded solution
%                      * `0` - Infeasible
%% 
% |solution.stat == 0|  means that the problem is overconstrainted and no feasible 
% flux vector v exists. The constraints need to be relaxed before the problem 
% will solve. See tutorial_relaxedFBA.mlx
% 
% |solution.stat = 2|  means that the problem is underconstrained to the extent 
% that the possible optimal value of the objective is unbounded, that is infinity, 
% or minus infinity. This means that extra constraints need to be added, e.g., 
% lower and upper bounds on the reaction rates.
% 
% |solution.stat = 1|  means that the problem is more complicated than either 
% of the above. It could be that the problem does, in principle, have a solution, 
% but that the current solver cannot find one, so an industrial quality solver 
% should be tested, e.g., gurobi. It could also mean that the FBA problem is poorly 
% scaled so there are numerical problems solving it, or it could also be just 
% slightly infeasible, in which case a higher precision solver will be required 
% to solve the problem, e.g., a quadruple precision solver. The way each solver 
% reports the nature of the problem varies between solvers, so checking |solution.origStat| 
% against the documentation that comes with each solver is necessary to figure 
% out what the potential solution is.

%    solution.stat - Solver status in standardized form:
%                      * `-1` - No solution reported (timelimit, numerical problem etc)
%                      * `1` - Optimal solution
%                      * `2` - Unbounded solution
%                      * `0` - Infeasible
