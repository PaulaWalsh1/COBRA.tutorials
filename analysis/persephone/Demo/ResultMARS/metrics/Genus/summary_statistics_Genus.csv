,Pre mapping,Post mapping,Mapping coverage,Description
Total number of taxa,177.0,152.0,0.8587570621468926,The number of taxa across all samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Estimated total number of named taxa,177.0,152.0,,"The estimated number of taxa following standard nomenclature. Estimated by excluding all taxa whose names contain ""-"" &/or multiple uppercase letters in a row."
Mean taxa richness,106.6,87.6,0.8217636022514071,Mean number of taxa across samples (equals to species richness on species taxonomic level). MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Std taxa richness,18.8,17.036431551237484,,Standard deviation of taxa richness.
Mean pielous evenness,0.2793889516201269,0.2538315831964068,-0.025557368423720084,"Mean alpha-diversity (calc. by pielous evenness) in samples. Towards 0: low diversity, towards 1: high diversity, with 1: complete evenness. MappingCoverage = post mapping - pre mapping."
Std pielous evenness,0.017519808880004827,0.012052390026118411,,Standard deviation of pielous evenness.
