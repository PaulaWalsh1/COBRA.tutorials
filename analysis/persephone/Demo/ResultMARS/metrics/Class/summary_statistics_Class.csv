,Pre mapping,Post mapping,Mapping coverage,Description
Total number of taxa,17.0,15.0,0.8823529411764706,The number of taxa across all samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Estimated total number of named taxa,17.0,15.0,,"The estimated number of taxa following standard nomenclature. Estimated by excluding all taxa whose names contain ""-"" &/or multiple uppercase letters in a row."
Mean taxa richness,13.8,12.8,0.927536231884058,Mean number of taxa across samples (equals to species richness on species taxonomic level). MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Std taxa richness,1.6,1.16619037896906,,Standard deviation of taxa richness.
Mean pielous evenness,0.25365710689041265,0.16511664411067578,-0.08854046277973687,"Mean alpha-diversity (calc. by pielous evenness) in samples. Towards 0: low diversity, towards 1: high diversity, with 1: complete evenness. MappingCoverage = post mapping - pre mapping."
Std pielous evenness,0.06267567764527013,0.0354751956267336,,Standard deviation of pielous evenness.
Mean read counts,7935919.4,6337799.0,0.7986218962858922,Mean number of reads across samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Std read counts,2402703.3591303444,2677269.0076579154,,Standard deviation of read counts.
