,Pre mapping,Post mapping,Mapping coverage,Description
Total number of taxa,11.0,9.0,0.8181818181818182,The number of taxa across all samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Estimated total number of named taxa,11.0,9.0,,"The estimated number of taxa following standard nomenclature. Estimated by excluding all taxa whose names contain ""-"" &/or multiple uppercase letters in a row."
Mean taxa richness,8.6,7.2,0.8372093023255814,Mean number of taxa across samples (equals to species richness on species taxonomic level). MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Std taxa richness,1.4966629547095764,0.9797958971132712,,Standard deviation of taxa richness.
Mean pielous evenness,0.26403168094150536,0.2044592504309334,-0.059572430510571955,"Mean alpha-diversity (calc. by pielous evenness) in samples. Towards 0: low diversity, towards 1: high diversity, with 1: complete evenness. MappingCoverage = post mapping - pre mapping."
Std pielous evenness,0.05422825056937081,0.044392050625205466,,Standard deviation of pielous evenness.
Mean read counts,7935939.6,6337799.0,0.7986198634878724,Mean number of reads across samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
