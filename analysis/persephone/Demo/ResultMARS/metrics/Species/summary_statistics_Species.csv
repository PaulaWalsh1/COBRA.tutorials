,Pre mapping,Post mapping,Mapping coverage,Description
Total number of taxa,447.0,308.0,0.6890380313199105,The number of taxa across all samples. MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Estimated total number of named taxa,412.0,308.0,,"The estimated number of taxa following standard nomenclature. Estimated by excluding all taxa whose names contain ""-"" &/or multiple uppercase letters in a row."
Mean taxa richness,264.4,170.4,0.6444780635400909,Mean number of taxa across samples (equals to species richness on species taxonomic level). MappingCoverage = post mapping/pre mapping.
Std taxa richness,42.15020759142237,29.186298155127517,,Standard deviation of taxa richness.
