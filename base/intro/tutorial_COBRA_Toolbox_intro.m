%% (tbc) Introduction to the COBRA Toolbox
%% Author(s): Ronan Fleming, Leiden University
%% Reviewer(s): 
%% INTRODUCTION
% _The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce a novice to the COBRA toolbox._
%% MATERIALS - EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Please ensure that all the required dependencies (e.g. , |git| and |curl|) 
% of The COBRA Toolbox have been properly installed by following the installation 
% guide <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html here>. 
% Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been initialised (tutorial_initialize.mlx) 
% and verify that the pre-packaged LP and QP solvers are functional (tutorial_verify.mlx).
%% PROCEDURE
% 
%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% _Please include TROUBLESHOOTING callouts after steps where problems are encountered. 
% Include full details of the problem and solutions in a later Troubleshooting 
% section._ 
%% TIMING
% _If possible, please include a timeline indicating the approximate time a 
% step, or set of steps, will take e.g. Steps 1–3, 30 min.; Steps 6+7, 2 h. Provide 
% this information as a summary at the end of the procedure, as a list. If you 
% think it would be more user friendly you could refer to time needed for each 
% section or detail what needs to be performed on each day of the protocol._
%% _TROUBLESHOOTING_
% _After key steps, include information on how to troubleshoot the most likely 
% problems users will encounter with the tutorial. Ideally provide this information 
% in the form ‘problem’, ‘possible reason’, ‘solution’._ 
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% _Include information about, or examples of, the likely outcome to users, for 
% example, likely solution to an optimisation problem, etc. Include example that 
% works very well and a second for that requires troubleshooting to obtain meaningful 
% results. If not described in detail in the introduction, this is a good place 
% to include directions on how to interpret and analyze the computational results 
% including equations if necessary._
%% _Acknowledgments_
% _Please note an acknowledgments section can be included._
%% REFERENCES
% _List all references mentioned in the protocol. References are numbered sequentially 
% as they appear in the text, figure legends, tables and boxes. Use superscript 
% numbers to indicate a reference, for example 1 . Only one publication is given 
% for each number, and footnotes are not used. Only papers that have been published 
% or accepted by a named publication should be in the numbered list; meeting abstracts 
% and papers in preparation should be mentioned in the text with a list of authors 
% (or initials if any of the authors are co-authors of the present contribution). 
% Patents should be included in the reference list. Published conference abstracts 
% and URLs for web sites should be cited parenthetically in the text, not in the 
% reference list; articles in formal, peer-reviewed online journals should be 
% included in the reference list. Grant details and acknowledgments are not permitted 
% as numbered references._
% 
% _All authors should be included in reference lists unless there are more than 
% five, in which case only the first author should be given, followed by 'et al.'. 
% Authors should be listed last name first, followed by a comma and initials of 
% given names. Titles of cited articles are required and should be in Roman text 
% and titles of books in italics; the first word of the title is capitalized, 
% the title written exactly as it appears in the work cited, ending with a period. 
% Journal names are italicized and abbreviated (with periods) according to common 
% usage; refer to the National Library of Medicine for details. Volume numbers 
% appear in bold. For book citations, the publisher and city of publication are 
% required (e.g. John Wiley & Sons,  Hoboken, New Jersey, USA, 2003)._
