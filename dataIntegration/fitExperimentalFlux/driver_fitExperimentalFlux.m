%% Fit a COBRA model to an experimental flux vector
% A given vector of experimentally measured fluxes $v_{\exp }$, may not be consistent 
% with the feasible set of steady state fluxes. Specifically, inconsistent with 
% the set defined by the steady state constraint (Sv=0) as well as the lower and 
% upper bounds on each reactionl, l ≤ v ≤ u. Should this occur, we fit the model 
% to the experimental data, relaxing the constraints on the bounds, that admits 
% a steady state flux v , using the following quadriatic optimisation problem
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\underset{v,p,q}{\textrm{min}} & (v_{exp}-v)^{T}\textrm{diag}(w_{exp})(v_{exp}-v)+p^{T}\textrm{diag}(w_{l})p+q^{T}\textrm{diag}(w_{u})q\\\;\text{s.t.} 
% & Sv=0,\\ & l-p\leq v\leq u+q,\\ & 0\le p\\ & 0\le q\end{array}$$
% 
% where    p ≥ 0 and    q  ≥ 0  are non-negative variables that permit relaxation 
% of the lower and upper bound constraints, respectively. This formulation also 
% allows for different weights to be input as parameters to penalise deviation 
% from experimentally measured mean fluxes, with $w_{\exp }$ = weightExp, penalise 
% relaxation of lower bounds, with           $w_l$ = weightLower,  and penalise 
% relaxation of upper bounds, with $w_u$ = weightUpper. For example, if the experimentally 
% measured flux is actually the mean flux, then one could set $w_{\exp }$ to be 
% the inverse of the variance on the experimental flux measurements, thereby increasing 
% the penalty on deviation from an experimentally measured mean flux where the 
% variance is lower. Certain lower or upper bounds might not be realistic to be 
% relaxed, e.g., an essential amino acid can always be taken up but never secreted, 
% therefore the upper bound on the corresponding exchange reaction must be zero. 
% The code below also works if there are additional coupling constraints, $\textrm{Cv}\le 
% \;d$, but these are not relaxed.
